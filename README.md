    * The home page video is featured across all multi-media screen sizes. This instantly gives users access to quick, and essential knowledge of the history of the sport. This was essential to include, so users can gain an understanding of taekwondo.
    * Given the fact that the video was embedded from youtube, via a third party website. It made it increasingly difficult to maintain a consistent aspect ratio, which caused some visibility issues. In future, it would be best to use a different method to ensure consitent, and readable viewership for users.
    * The video will remain static unless the user interacts with it. This is done to avoid causing an unpleasant experience, if a user does not want it to play automatically.
